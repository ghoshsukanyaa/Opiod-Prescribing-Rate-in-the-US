# Opioid-Prescribing-Rate-in-the-US
Introduction: 
Opioids are a class of drugs used to reduce pain.
The major broad classes of opioids are:
a) Prescription Opioids: Prescribed by doctors to treat moderate to severe pain but can also have serious risks and side effects. Common types are oxycodone (OxyContin), hydrocodone (Vicodin), morphine, and methadone.
b) Synthetic Opioids: Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid pain reliever. It is many times more potent than other opioids and is approved for treating severe pain, typically advanced cancer pain. Illegally made and distributed fentanyl has been on the rise in several states.
c) Heroin: It is an illegal opioid. 25 people died every day from a heroin overdose in the United States in 2021.

More than 75% of drug overdose deaths in 2021 involved an opioid. In 2021, 45 people died each day from an opioid overdose.
Overdoses involving opioids killed more than 80,000 people in 2021, and nearly 88% of those deaths involved synthetic opioids. Altogether, 645,000 people have died from an opioidÂ overdose (1999-2021).

Problem Statement:
The goal is to optimize resource allocation for addiction treatment and prevention as a means to address the opioid crisis. Through targeted strategies and regression analysis, we aim to mitigate societal and economic consequences while making data-driven decisions for more effective interventions against opioid overuse.
